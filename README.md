# GZSL_OS-GZSL

This repository contains the implementation of our approach proposed for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL), which combines VAE-GAN-based generative modeling with clustering-based feature selection.

ðŸ“Œ The corresponding paper is currently under review and will be made available here upon publication.
